# Assignment 1 - Write UP

## Description
This is the portion of the assignment that will be graded.  I will be looking at your other files, and specifically either `a1.py` or `a1_ai_problems.py`.  I will be looking to see that you completed the problems or used a generative AI to help you come up with and complete some challenge questions.  This document will help guide you through that process.

## Options for Assignment 1
- Complete the `a1.py` file completely and answer the reflection questions in this file.  Mr. Berg will be looking at both files.
- Complete the `python_with_generative_ai.md` and put your programming portions in `a1_ai_problems.py`.

Mr. Berg will look at all your files to determine what you have completed.  If there are any questions for this assignment, Mr. Berg will ask in class after he grades them.


## Reflection Questions

1. What is your initial thoughts about the python programming language?
It feels intuitive. The structure is pretty simple (for i in blank) and generally things are named as they should be (length of a list is len).


2. Describe some similarities and differences that you found between python and other programming languages you have used in the past?
Indentation matters much more in python than it does in Java. In python indentation is required for loops and if statements to work, but in java it is only for organization. You also dont need to worry about what type your variable is in python when creating it where you do need to worry in Java.


3. What are some things that you learned through this assignment?
Ive learned the basics of how to create some of the most commnly used functions such as while loops, for loops, if statements, and more. I also learned a bit about a new approach to solving problems te python way sinstead of the java way.
